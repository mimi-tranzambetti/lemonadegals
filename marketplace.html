        <div style=" padding-right:20%; padding-left:20%;">
            <p> These stickers will be distributed primarily on USC’s campus to avoid mailing fees! Our target audience is students at USC who we think fall into various personas which we’ve written about below. The Lemonade Gals manufacture them in the Iovine and Young Academy Garage and package them with love to give to our customers. Ideally, the company will have pick-up spots on campus hubs where students can easily grab their purchases on the way to class. </p>

            <h3> Personas </h3>


            <p> Because the Lemonade Gals are heavily leaning towards one political view, the target market is a little more narrow. People that we are striving to market towards are people that are passionate about their beliefs, are afraid of the future, or generally uncomfortable with current politics. At least 3.3 million people participated in over 500 marches across the US. Estimates show one out of every 100 Americans participated in the march, which is astonishing. </p>

            <p> The Lemonade Gals targets 4 types of people. They range from 18 to their 40's; although younger markets may have interest in the products, they are not the ones with purchasing power. However, our product will hopefully be able to trickle down into all markets. Older generations can also relate, but we decided to narrow our market to one that we specifically have reach to, which is the college campus demographic. Therefore, 2 of the 4 are college-aged students, while 1 person is new to the job market. </p>

            <p> One of the college students is located in the liberal west coast and is engaged politically, socially, and creatively. The other student is a male because we did not want to just limit our audience to females. Although our branding is female-centric (#girlpower,) we recognize allies to the feminist movement and understand the varied political beliefs of both genders. Our 25 year-old journalist is the most active in politics, wanting to highlight the importance of real news over "alternative facts." She is not afraid to state the facts and her beliefs, and will rally for any issue she believes in, but understands the need for unbiased reporting. </p>

            <p> Our most important customer segment is shown through the middle aged former Republican, who although may have different political beliefs than the other three segments, believes in educating others and instilling strong moral values, which she did see represented in the current Republican party. </p>


            <h3> Competitors </h3>

            <p> Our competitors on campus remain very few, as there aren’t many agencies devoted to only sticker-making and design. In addition, we narrow our scope even more by speaking about social issues. Most other organizations on campus design their stickers for very specific purposes, such as promotion. The Lemonade Gals are the first design agency with such a specific purpose.
